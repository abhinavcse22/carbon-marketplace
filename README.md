# Carbon Credit Marketplace

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized, transparent, and efficient marketplace for carbon credits, leveraging blockchain technology to drive global sustainability efforts. By tokenizing carbon credits and providing a user-friendly platform for trading, we aim to increase accessibility and liquidity in the carbon offset market, ultimately contributing to the fight against climate change.

## Overview

The Carbon Credit Marketplace is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Neo X blockchain, utilizing smart contracts to facilitate the trading of carbon credits. This platform promotes sustainability by creating a transparent and efficient market for carbon offset trading.

- **Decentralized Order Book**: Users can create buy and sell orders for carbon credits.
- **User Reputation System**: Tracks user trading history to build trust in the marketplace.
- **Admin Functions**: Privileged users can mint new carbon credit tokens.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly interface.
- **Real-time Market Data**: Live updates of order book and user balances.
- **Seamless Web3 Integration**: Easy connection with MetaMask and other Web3 wallets.
